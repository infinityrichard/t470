# Lenovo T470 Hackintosh EFI Folder
This project has been abandoned, for now. My T470 now runs Debian GNU/Linux. After debating whether I should spend $50 on a WiFi card for this project I decided against it.

One day I may get a smaller USB dongle that doesn't protrude from my case much and use that instead, but for now I'm fine with Debian.

I do still have a copy of macOS on a slow external disk to test this folder in every new (major) macOS version. 

This folder currently works on macOS 10.14.3. I have not tested on 10.14.4.
